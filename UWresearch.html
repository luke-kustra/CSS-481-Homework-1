    <p class="spacing">I worked on a multidisciplinary University of Washington research</p>
    <p>team developing autonomous navigation software for a driverless all terrain</p>
    <p>vehicle. My role focused on designing and implementing machine learning driven</p>
    <p>perception and decision making systems that enabled the vehicle to detect</p>
    <p>obstacles and navigate toward target locations in simulated environments.</p>
    <p>I implemented object detection algorithms using LiDAR sensor data, allowing the</p>
    <p>system to recognize obstacles and perform actions such as stopping, turning, and</p>
    <p>route correction. While the physical vehicle was not tested directly, key aspects</p>
    <p>of the vehicle and software stack were modeled and validated using ROS, enabling</p>
    <p>realistic simulation of sensor inputs, vehicle behavior, and control logic.</p>
    <p>To support model development and evaluation, I used PyTorch and datasets such as</p>
    <p>KITTI to train and assess perception models under realistic conditions. Development</p>
    <p>was primarily done in C++ and Python within a Linux virtual machine environment,</p>
    <p>with close collaboration across disciplines to ensure proper integration between</p>
    <p>perception, planning, and control components.</p>

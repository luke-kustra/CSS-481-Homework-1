    <img class="pic-center" src="DashBeastLogo.png" width="500" height="150" alt="DashBeast Logo">
    <p>My role at Dashbeast Inc. was to create a Machine Learning Model that accepts</p>
    <p>acceleration, gyroscopic, and magnetometer data in the X, Y, and Z directions.</p>
    <p>Using that data the model will predict what exercise the user is performing,</p>
    <p>such as a bench press, a squat, or a pushup. This model utilized a One-Dimensional</p>

    <img class="pic-center spacing" src="code_snippet.png" width="600" height="400" alt="DashBeast Model Architecture">

    <p class="spacing"> This model utilized a <a href= https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/introduction-convolution-neural-network/> One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Model.</a></p>
    <p>The training of which involves the stacking of four Conv1D blocks with BatchNorm,</p>
    <p>ReLU, and max-pooling to learn temporal patterns and downsample the sequence, </p>
    <p>then flattening to two fully connected layers with dropout before a final linear</p>
    <p>layer that outputs logits for each exercise class (trained with cross-entropy loss).</p>

    <img class="pic-center spacing" src="json snippet.png" width="600" height="200" alt="DashBeast JSON Output">

    <p class="spacing"> The model then outputs a .json file with what workout the model</p>
    <p>predicts the user is performing alongside a confidence score for that prediction.</p>
    <p>The .json file makes the ML feature module for other systems to interact with the </p>
    <p>model easily. Overall, this project was a great experience in learning how to</p>
    <p>build and deploy machine learning models for real world applications! I learned</p>
    <p>more about data preprocessing, model architecture design using Pytorch, and model</p>
    <p>evaluation through this internship that I could definitely recreate for personal or</p>
    <p>professional projects.</p>
